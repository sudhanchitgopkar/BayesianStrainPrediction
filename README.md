This project was developed by sudhan.chitgopkar as research completed during his time as a research fellow for curo @ uga.

This code calculates the Levenshtein's Distance between two strings, traces back the optimal steps taken by the Levenshtein's Distance Algorithm, and provides a rudimentary visualization.
For more information regarding the nature of the code, to access visualizations developed in the Processing environment, or about this project in general, sudhan can be contacted at sudhanchitgopkar.com.
